Each of these examples show how to perform a given Docker operation using the Go and Python SDKs and the HTTP API using curl.

Run a container
This first example shows how to run a container using the Docker API. On the command line, you would use the docker run command, but this is just as easy to do from your own apps too.

This is the equivalent of executing at the command prompt

$ docker run alpine echo hello world

You can also run containers in the background.

This is equivalent of typing:

$ docker run -d bfirsh/reticulate-splines
